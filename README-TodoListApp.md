 This is a jQuery base Todo List App, with a heavy focus on CSS styling and animations and effect with jQuery JS. It's going to be a polished application. 

FUNCTIONALITY
	(1) responsive design
	(2) hoover delete button (if want to delete entirely)
	(3) click on text to cross off, but can still see
	(4) click, fades out, disappears
	(5) input, to add no todo
	(6) button to hide form "input"

BEHIND IT
	(1) More practice with:

		jQuery (Events)
			- .on()
			- .keypress()
			- Fades and Slides
			- Selecting
		
		CSS (box model)
			- margin
			- padding
			- float
			- fonts

	(2) New Things! - a better folder structure!!!

	* We're gonna have subdirectories and break things out into different sections

		jQuery
			- 2 new methods
				- .parent()
				- .append()
					- Creating Elements
			- Event Delegation

		CSS
			- Font-Awesome (another library for icons)
			- Box-Shadow
			- Transition
			- Gradients
